# Day 17 - Play with JavaScript

There is no way we could reasonably teach you all you need to know about JavaScript in just one chapter. Instead, I am using blah blah.

### JavaScript in the Console

All major web browser come shipped with JavaScript[^majorbrowsers].  Without getting into too many details, what this means is that the browser can *read* and *run* the JavaScript language[^jsengine].  

For us, this also means that we can type JavaScript directly into the browser's DevTool's Console and it will read and run JavaScript on the fly. 

#### Exercise 3 of 12: JavaScript in the Console
1\. In a browser, open the [`4-javascript/js-example-1.html`](code/src/4-javascript/js-example-1.html) file we used [Exercise #1](#exercise-1).

Next, open the DevTools.    

2\. Navigate to the **Console**.  You'll find this panel just to the **right** of the Elements panel.

3\. The **Console** is a panel in the DevTools where Chrome executes commands that you type there. The Console is not unique to Chrome.  All major browsers have one.  

4\. Go ahead and type or copy-paste the following commands into the Console.  Once added, press **enter** to execute the command.  

I>In the following screenshots, you will see the word `undefined`. This is what the browser returns after declaring a variable.  We don't need to know why that is, just know that the screenshots will include what the browser returns.  I point this out, so you don't think you need to type `undefined`, that's just what the browser returns after you hit `enter`.  You should be typing what follows the symbol `>`, and the computer's response follows the symbol `<`. 

For the following command, go ahead and replace `Angel` with your name. 
{#vars}

The screenshots include the browser's response.  For example, in the previous screenshot, you don't need to type in `"Angel"` in the last line, "Angel" is the response from the browser after you typed `name` and hit enter. This will make sense once you start typing in the Console.

5\. The next couple of commands perform simple calculations.  Go ahead and type these in the Console as well.

6\. Next, we'll trigger a prompt message (a window that opens up asking you to fill something in).  To do this, type the `prompt` command into the Console with a message.

Now enter a response in the prompt that pops up and click "OK". Look back in the Console.  You should see your response.

The above Exercises are designed to get you familiar with playing with JavaScript in the Console.  Don't get caught up on the syntax; get comfortable with executing JavaScript in the Console.

// Again, can't teach it here, but wan't you to understand what it does.

// Next other programming languages.
