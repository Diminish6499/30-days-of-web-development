# Day 27 - File Systems and Types

### File System

We now have a better understanding of how to navigate around our computer, but what exactly are you navigating _in_? If you were the captain of a ship, I basically just showed you how to sail a ship, but did not tell you if you'd be in the Atlantic, Bering Strait, or a bathtub.

Your computer uses a File System to organize everything on it, and it is this File System that you're navigating around when inside the terminal. Whenever you are moving files, creating folders, or deleting things you are doing those things on the computer's File System.

The File System is your terminals equivalent of the captain's bathtub.

#### File Types

The File System is made up of two types of files:

1\. **Data files**. Think anything that contains data, text files, word docs, images, mp3, etc.

For example, all the files that you've downloaded and have been working within the code folder that came with this book are data files. Some are .html files, some are .png, but they all are data files.

2\. **Executable files**. These are files that when you open them, they execute something. It's a good bet that any file in your Applications folder is an executable file.

All of these files run a program on your computer. When you open _Adobe Illustrator_ or the _Calculator_ application you are running executable files[^appexe].

Another, less obvious, example of an executable file are the commands we've been running in Terminal. Think about it; every time we executed a command in the Terminal, the commands _do_ something. Behind the scenes, these commands are linked to executable files.

// maybe an exercise.  Quiz with executable vs. none.
