# Day 01 - Why is JavaScript important

No matter what kind of programmer you decide to become, JavaScript is a language that you will need to know.  The most recent statistics show that JavaScript is used by about **95% of all websites**[^percent].

JavaScript is _everywhere_ and because your browser can read and process the JavaScript language, anyone with access to a web browser can, in theory, program in JavaScript.  

Sometimes to appreciate something, you have to lose it.  We're going to take that approach with JavaScript; we're going to interact with the web *without* JavaScript.  Hopefully, this Exercise will show you just how much of your day-to-day interactions with the web rely on JavaScript.

#### Exercise 2 of 12: The Web without JavaScript

1\. In your Chrome settings there is an option to disable JavaScript, [here is a quick link](chrome://settings/content/javascript?search=javaScript) to get there.

2\.  Toggle off JavaScript.

3\. Get ready to miss JavaScript.

Go ahead and toggle on and off the JavaScript option in Chrome and compare before and after versions of various websites.  Some good websites to try are Twitter or YouTube or try searching for something on Google.

Here is what Twitter looks like without JavaScript enabled; ugly and hard to use.

4\. Don't forget to turn JavaScript back on.  You may need to close and open your browser again for JavaScript to be reapplied.

Did you miss it?  I sure did.  The web isn't the same without JavaScript.
