# Day 18 - What is a Programming Language

How do you know what Programming Language to learn? Do you need to learn more than one Programming Language, and if so in what order should you learn them?

While I can't answer these questions for you, I _can_ give you the resources and some guidance so you can answer those questions for yourself.

In this chapter, we will discuss the **state of programming languages**, which ones are the most heavily used, and what they are used for. We will look at **recent job postings for programmers**, going through the requirements to decipher what programming languages the job might require.

My hope is to show you how to use these tools, and then, depending on your level of curiosity on the subject, you can use those tools to answer questions specific to your interests or needs.
