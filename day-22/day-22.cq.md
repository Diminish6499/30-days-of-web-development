# Day 22 - Job searching for web developers.

I want to get you comfortable looking at programming job descriptions, keeping an eye out on the language requirements.

By the end of this, I hope you'll have a better understanding of which roles you're interested in when you go into web development.

In this section, we will look at the following job posting sites.

I> It should go without saying that there are a TON of job posting sites out there. I choose to focus on these 3 because they post jobs specifically for developers.

- [**GitHub Jobs**](https://jobs.github.com/)
- [**StackOverflow Jobs**](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs)
- [**Smashing Magazine Jobs**](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/jobs/)

We could spend a whole day looking at different job postings, but I am going to assume that, depending on your level of curiosity, you can continue the following exercise for as long as you'd like. I am just going to get you started, focusing on where to find information about programming languages.

// NEW job posting here, to investigate.


// ARG: add additional resources - remotejobs.org
// TOP SASS companies. 
// LinkedIN
// Twitter.

// ARG: next we'll investigate a quintessential deveoper tool - the terminal.  Hint: we'll be revisiting the concept of a shells address in the XX blog post on OS.
