# Day 15 - Adding Interactivity - JavaScript

HTML gives the web structure. CSS provides that structure with style.  **JavaScript makes that structure *interactive***.

To give you a better sense of what I mean by "interactive", we are going to play with JavaScript using HTML examples that have JavaScript already on them.

T> **JavaScript is a programming language**, unlike HTML and CSS, which are markup languages. We will learn more about Programming Languages in [the Programming Languages Chapter](#programming-language-chapter).

#### Exercise 1 of 12: What does "interactive" look like? {#exercise-1}
1\. In the code that comes with this book, open the following HTML file in a web browser:
[`4-javascript/js-example-1.html`](code/src/4-javascript/js-example-1.html). 

Once open you should see a web page that looks something like the following:

2\.  The rabbit and turtle will start racing right away.  Play around with stopping and restarting the animation.  

3\.  The "racing" between the rabbit and turtle, as well as the buttons "stopping" and "restarting" the race is all done by JavaScript.  This is an example of what interactivity looks like.

If you are curious and would like to look at the JavaScript causing this interactivity, in your text editor, navigate to row 61 on the `js-example-1.html` file.  Row 61 is where the JavaScript code starts.

T>Don't let the code overwhelm you. I simply want to point out where it lives on the HTML file.  By no means do I expect you to understand it.  

In this chapter, I will introduce you to some core JavaScript concepts. During this process, you should start to understand - even if only generally - how JavaScript affects your interactions/experience with web pages.
