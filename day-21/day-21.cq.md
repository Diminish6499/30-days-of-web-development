# Day 21 - Frameworks and Libraries

To get in front of what might later become confusing, I want to stop and quickly talk about **Frameworks and Libraries**.

You'll often hear people refer to _Frameworks_, _Libraries_, and _Programming Languages_ in the same breath.

I want to clarify with you that **they are different things**. To make it more difficult, the lines between a "library" and a "framework" aren't always clear.

For example, you may come across a job post requiring skills in PHP, React, and Angular.

- PHP is a Programing Language
- Angular is a Framework (made of up several Libraries)
- React could also be considered a Framework, even though there is a specific `React` library.

**Frameworks and Libraries are a collection of tools that support writing in a particular Programming Language**. For example, the popular Library called React was built by Facebook. Facebook built React to help manage data and make maintenance of their codebase more manageable[^whyreact].

React extends JavaScript, but it does not replace it. Therefore React isn't a Programming Language, just a tool that in many ways makes JavaScript more powerful.

Frameworks and Libraries have become a crucial part of web development, and something you will need to learn more about as you continue in Web Development. For now, know they exist and are often mentioned in the same space of programming languages.

T> **Learn the Programming Language First.** Once you have a handle on the language, then explore Libraries and Frameworks.
