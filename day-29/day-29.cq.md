# Day 29 - Introduction to GitHub, Git's BBF


GitHub is the single largest host for Git repositories[^gitbook131], with over 100 million repositories on its platform.  Not only is GitHub a powerful cloud hosting service provider, but it has also become a social media platform of sorts for millions of developers.   

This last statement might seem a little strange: how does a software platform that host code repositories provide social media type interactions?  Good question.  The answer, "open-source", meaning that code is available to view and improve upon.  A rising tide lifts all boats, right[^risingtide]?

The open-source ethos fly in the face of mainstream business norms.  How many scientists do you see openly sharing their findings, industry R&D giving away their trade secrets for free, or financial companies asking the public to help them improve their services?  You don't, but sharing, no-entry cost, and asking for contributions are the foundations of open-source development. 

GitHub plays a significant role in fostering open-source collaboration. It does this by making it very easy to contribute, share and communicate with each other.  

GitHub allows users to make repositories, which can either be set to private or free.  It also allows repositories to claim a license type, which is a certified sharing standard if you will.  If you'd like to learn more, [here is GitHub's](https://help.github.com/articles/licensing-a-repository/) documentation on how to choose and add a License.

In addition to making the repositories easy to access and claim an open-source license type, GitHub makes it very easy for other developers to make changes to a repositories code.  We covered this process in the Git in the Cloud section.

### Culture of GitHub

Before we wrap up our discussion on GitHub, I want to quickly talk about the culture of GitHub as a resume builder and community resource.

#### GitHub: the new resume

Your GitHub activity, profile, and repositories will be much more valuable to any prospective employer than your resume.  It's also likely that any project you take as part of the application process will be done using the Git / GitHub workflow.

Employers will use your GitHub profile to determine what if any projects you are contributing to, what projects you have made yourself and if you are actively using Git.  In the programming world, it's less about what school you went to, and more about what you've created or are contributing to.  If you have an active presence in the GitHub community, your future employer will be sure to take notice.  

#### Use GitHub whenever you can

Ask advice from any senior developer, and they will recommend you try and contribute to a GitHub repository.

It's a little tough (and intimidating) at first to start contributing to a repository though so that I would recommend you first create your repository and play around with that.

Continue to use best practices even if it's only yourself contributing to your repository; make side branches, open pull requests, and leave helpful commit messages.

#### Embrace the community

GitHub is huge, and the community loves ðŸ’œ contributors.  Take social cues from previous Pull Request. Make sure to read the README.md file, and explore.  

Here are some of my favorite GitHub repositories.  Let these encourage your explorations.  Star repositories and maybe start thinking about a project you are currently working on that would benefit from the Git / GitHub workflow.

## Git and GitHub usage statistics

Before we wrap things up, I want to talk more about who uses Git and GitHub, as well as back up my sprinkled statements of how popular Git and GitHub are with some statistics.

I>Feel free to skip this section if you feel comfortable accepting my claims - at face value - that Git and GitHub are the kings ðŸ‘‘ of their respective industry.

### Git: Who uses it

Any serious software company, large and small use Git.  It is an industry standard.  Poke around [Stackshare](https://stackshare.io/git) - a website we used in the Programming Languages chapter - to get a sense of all of the companies using Git.

It is only fair of me to note, however, that there are other Version Control Systems out there.  Subversion is probably Git's closest competitor.

Subversion is pre-git, and for a long time, it was the standard VCS.  For companies still using Subversion, it's a good bet that they are using a hybrid of Git and Subversion. There's a plugin that you can use with Git that allows you also to use Subversion. 

A quick look at [Google Trends comparing Git to Subversion](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=%2Fm%2F05vqwg,%2Fm%2F012ct9) paints a clear picture of Git's rise to dominance.

### GitHub: Who uses it

GitHub's success story is similar to Git's.  Though GitHub does have a few more serious competitors than Git does.  Mainly Bitbucket and GitLab.  It's less certain the GitHub will remain as dominant as it currently is, as there is some shuffling and true competition going on between the companies in this space.  For example, Microsoft recently purchased GitHub, which had lots of developers jumping to GitLab[^microsoft].  

I> This book was written using GitLab, and I'm a fan. If you care to read more about GitHub-vs-GitLab, I recommend [this article](https://hackernoon.com/github-vs-gitlab-which-is-better-for-open-source-projects-31c45d464be0).  The best part is probably the comment section.

A quick look at [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=%2Fm%2F04g0kcw,%2Fm%2F05mx6p6,%2Fm%2F0125_4f0) comparing GitHub with it's two closest competitors - Bitbucket and GitLab - helps us see that GitHub is still a safe bet.

One more stat before we wrap this up.  According to [GitHub's website](https://github.com/about/facts), there are more than 31 million registered users worldwide - you just added to that list by one when you signed up for an account ðŸ™‚.  

// ARG again mention exercises and setup in book.
