# Day 30 - Web Developer Field Guide

Web development, especially in the last 5+ years, has blown up and the content along with it.  There is a lot to learn, and honestly, you can't learn it all.  So that begs the question, what do you do next, and where do you go from here; how can you get a job as a Web Developer?

Having made it through to the past 29 blog posts, you now have a better sense of what topics and skills you'll need to become a Web Developer.

In this last article, I will not be introducing any new content or Exercises.  Instead, I have created a [**How to become a Web Developer Field Guide**](assets/public/map.png) (called "Field Guide 🗒" from here out).  The link is a printable 11X17 PDF that I would encourage you to either bookmark or print if you're the poster sorts.

The "Field Guide" comes from the book 📗"How to Become a Web Developer: A Field Guide."  This book covers in much more detail and with additional exercises, the topics covered in the last 29 days.  The 29 days are snapshots 📸 from the chapters of that book, which culminate into a final chapter that reviews the "Field Guide."  The PDF version of the field guide is a printable resource.  But it is missing some fundamental discussions about time spent, and recommended skill level for each trail post; things included in the final chapter of the book.

Here is an example of the expanded content found in the book on the CSS trail post.

### 2. CSS

#### Skill Level: Easy-Moderate
It's likely your HTML studies will mix with your CSS studies.  I would, however, spend more time on CSS than HTML. There are a lot of important topics I was not able to cover in the CSS chapter, but mention in the Further Reading section.

In addition to CSS, you should spend time learning about CSS Frameworks.  There are lots of CSS Frameworks; don't overdo it, just focusing on one is sufficient.  Get familiar with that framework's syntax, and if you'd like to use the framework instead of plain CSS in your project. 

Note: you should also spend a little time understanding what a CSS framework is.  You'll run into frameworks in your further JavaScript studies as well.

I>You'll know you're there when you can read and write ~50% of the CSS on a web page as well as debug and modify CSS using a browser's Developer Tools.

#### Project Suggestions
Using the same HTML page from your HTML project, add CSS to the page in all 3 ways; External, Internal, and Inline.  Get comfortable with overriding styles (hint: you'll need to learn at least a little about the cascading mechanism during this process).  

Having added styles, try your hand at adding a CSS animation.  You don't need to build one from scratch, but try adding a pre-built one and modifying it.  A quick search on codepen.io for [CSS animations](https://codepen.io/search/pens?q=css%20animations&page=1&order=popularity&depth=everything) should get you on your way. 

#### ⏰ Est. Hours Spent
* Time studying 10hrs
* Time working on project 25hrs

### What's next?
