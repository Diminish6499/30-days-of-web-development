# Day 30 - Web Developer Field Guide

Web development, especially in the last 5+ years, has blown up and the content along with it.  There is a lot to learn, and honestly, you can't learn it all.  So that begs the question, what do you do next, and where do you go from here; how can you get a job as a Web Developer?

As the title of this book suggests, this is a _field guide_ to web development.  This book alone and it's content won't get you far enough along to get a job, but it aims to get you on the most direct path to get one.

Having made it through to the last chapter, you now have the information and skills to make an educated decision about the next step; and honestly, that puts you ahead of most.  The reality is, even for folks coming out of a computer science degree or going into a "coding bootcamp", unless they have taken the time to understand what the field of web development looks like they may not be adequately prepared to decide that next step.  You are.

In this last chapter, as promised, I will not be introducing any new content or Exercises.  Instead, we have created a [**How to become a Web Developer Field Guide**](images/9-field-guide/map.png) (called "Field Guide üóí" from here out).  The link is a printable 11X17 PDF that I would encourage you to either bookmark or print if you're the poster sorts.  The "Field Guide" covers where we have been, some potential "goat üêê trails" along the way, and discusses some next steps.

Resources and next steps.
