# Day 09 - Giving your HTML some style ðŸ˜Ž - CSS

In the last several blog posts we looked at HTML.

Admittedly, all the examples in the HTML articles didn't look very good. They were rather dull, with no color or unique font. We're going to change that by introducing **CSS**.

CSS works hand-in-hand with HTML to give your web page "style."

This chapter is an overview of CSS, covering some of the more essential concepts, and reviewing basic syntax.

## What is CSS

Cascading Style Sheets, better known as **CSS**, is a stylesheet language. 

You may be asking yourself, why two different languages: HTML _and_ CSS? Without getting into the history of it all, the simple answer to that question is that each has a role.  Where HTML defines the structure, CSS gives the structure _style_.

Style includes things like **color**, **font**, **size**, **layout**, and **position**. Need to make a paragraph blue? HTML defines the paragraph, and CSS makes the paragraph blue.
