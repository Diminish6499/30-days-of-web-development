# Day 01 - How to Add Style - CSS

In the previous chapter, we introduced you to HTML.  You learned some basic syntax and should have walked away with a rough understanding of what a web page is.

Admittedly, all the examples in that chapter didn't look very good. They were rather dull, with no color or unique font. In this chapter, we'll change that. 

Here we are going to introduce you to  **CSS**.  CSS works hand-in-hand with HTML to give your web page "style."

This chapter is an overview of CSS, covering some of the more essential concepts, and reviewing basic syntax.

## What is CSS

Cascading Style Sheets, better known as **CSS**, is a stylesheet language. 

You may be asking yourself, why two different languages: HTML _and_ CSS? Without getting into the history of it all, the simple answer to that question is that each has a role.  Where HTML defines the structure, CSS gives the structure _style_.

Style includes things like **color**, **font**, **size**, **layout**, and **position**. Need to make a paragraph blue? HTML defines the paragraph, and CSS makes the paragraph blue.
